# code-quiz

The objective of this project was to create a quiz.  The quiz will have a countdown timer and a place for high scores.  If the player choses an answer incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from their timer. We were to generate html, css, and js files to complete the project.

# How to Access the Work

I will be supplying a url to the project along with a git hub url.  

# Things needed to view

All files are nested in the code-quiz file.  The index.html is a file that is linked to both a style sheet (style.css) and to a javascript file (script.js).  There is also an image file.  For alternate viewports, a viewport meta tag was included on the html pages.

# Challenges and Observations

Although I can see that I have come a long way in utilizing html, css and js skills, I could have easily taken another week with the project.  I set up the html and css pages quickly, and spent most of my time in javascript.  I really struggled with the functionality of to get the questions on the page.  I spend a great deal of time experimenting with loops, but didn't get the result I wanted.  I ultimately decided against the loop, and put a counter into a function, but it isn't working perfectly either. 
I could have spent many more hours on this if time allowed.

I did feel good about getting my Event Listeners to work.  I feel like that was a success!  Unfortunately, I left the high score portion and styling to the end,so I didn't have the time to really get those in place as desired (Yes, I know this looks like a cheesy waiting room game from the 90's !).

Overall, I found this to be incredibly challenging; and I admit, I felt quite discouraged in the process. Since I was scrambling to apply so many different things into one project, I didn't feel like I was able to perfect any one thing.  Given more time, I know I could have done a much better job with this; however, I think having this under my belt, I think I could start fresh on a new project with a revised thought process and perspective.
